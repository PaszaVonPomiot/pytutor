    "# Single Responsibility Principle\r\n",
    "The Single Responsibility Principle requires that module or class should have only one job. So if a class has more than one responsibility, it becomes coupled. A change to one responsibility results to modification of the other responsibility.\r\n",
    "The single responsibility principle states that every module or class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class. All its services should be narrowly aligned with that responsibility.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Eg. class to manage address book - add, remove, change, lookup entries but not save to file or database."
